Ques 1: Write about MAC Architecture,function, and channel structure.

MAC (Medium Access Control) Architecture:
 

The MAC architecture is a sublayer of the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) in the OSI model. It is responsible for controlling how devices access a shared network medium, such as a wireless channel or Ethernet cable.

Functions:

1. Channel Access: MAC manages access to the shared medium, ensuring that only one device transmits at a time.
2. Frame Formatting: MAC formats data into frames, adding headers and trailers as needed.
3. Error Detection and Correction: MAC performs error detection and correction using techniques like CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) and ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request).
4. Flow Control: MAC regulates data transmission rates to prevent network congestion.
5. Multiplexing: MAC multiplexes data from multiple logical channels onto a single physical channel.

Channel Structure:

The MAC channel structure consists of:

1. Logical Channels: Multiple logical channels are multiplexed onto a single physical channel.
2. Transport Channels: Transport channels carry user data and signaling information.
3. Control Channels: Control channels carry control information, such as scheduling and resource allocation.
4. Physical Channels: Physical channels are the actual transmission medium, such as a wireless frequency band or Ethernet cable.

Key Components:

1. MAC Header: Added to the beginning of each frame, containing control information like source and destination addresses.
2. MAC Trailer: Added to the end of each frame, containing error detection and correction information.
3. Frame Body: The payload of the frame, containing user data or control information.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ques 2: Mac procedure, random access Procedure.
MAC Procedure:

1. Data Arrival: Data arrives from higher layers for transmission.
2. Frame Formation: MAC forms a frame by adding headers and trailers to the data.
3. Channel Sensing: MAC senses the channel to check for availability.
4. Transmission: MAC transmits the frame over the channel.
5. Acknowledgment: MAC receives an acknowledgment (ACK) or negative acknowledgment (NACK) from the receiver.
6. Error Handling: MAC performs error handling, such as retransmission, if an error occurs.

Random Access Procedure:

1. Data Arrival: Data arrives from higher layers for transmission.
2. Random Access Preamble: MAC selects a random access preamble and transmits it over the channel.
3. Random Access Response: MAC receives a random access response (RAR) from the base station.
4. Timing Advance: MAC adjusts its transmission timing based on the RAR.
5. Scheduling Request: MAC sends a scheduling request to the base station.
6. Scheduling Grant: MAC receives a scheduling grant from the base station.
7. Data Transmission: MAC transmits the data over the channel.

Note: Random access procedure is used in wireless networks, such as LTE and 5G, for initial access and connection establishment.

Key differences between MAC procedure and Random Access Procedure:

- MAC procedure is a general procedure for data transmission, while Random Access Procedure is specifically designed for initial access and connection establishment in wireless networks.
- Random Access Procedure involves additional steps, such as random access preamble transmission and scheduling request, to establish a connection with the base station.
